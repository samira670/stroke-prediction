**Stroke Prediction Model**
**Overview**
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting strokes based on various health parameters from the "Stroke Prediction Dataset". The project utilizes several machine learning algorithms to model and predict whether a person is likely to have a stroke based on attributes like gender, age, heart disease, and more.

**Dataset**

The dataset used is the "Stroke Prediction Dataset" which includes several attributes related to health and personal information. Key columns include:

gender
age
hypertension
heart_disease
ever_married
work_type
Residence_type
avg_glucose_level
bmi
smoking_status
stroke


**Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and outliers.**

Data Preprocessing: Encoding categorical variables and scaling.
Model Training: Training different machine learning models including Random Forest, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting.
Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
